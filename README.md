# Enhancing-Network-Lifetime-in-WSN
Enhancing WSN lifetime through optimized sink configurations, intrusion-aware protocols, and a tailored machine learning model for improved accuracy and resilience. This study compares 2 vs. 3 sink setups, introduces an intrusion-tolerant protocol, and demonstrates a novel ML model's effectiveness on WSN data.
